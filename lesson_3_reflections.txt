Question: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository for a few reasons. My first reason is to keep my data safe. If something were to happen to
my main computer, I would want to still be able to access all my work. I would also use a remote repository because I want to be
able to access my code on different computers. I have a desktop, laptop, and work computer. It is easier to use a remote repository
to access my work instead of having to continually download and transfer my work by flash drive. And I would also want to use a 
remote repository so that I can have others contribute to my work. If we all work together, we can make the world a better place!!!

Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?

My main reason for not wanting Git to automatically pull would be because there might be changes made by myself or others that I'm
not ready to have be a part of the final code. The commits are there to help manage the logical changes made to the code, so too
should pulls and also pushes be done at logical changes and only once both sources are reviewed to make sure there is no conflic
with the code or no unexpected chagnes.

Question: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of
another?

The difference is that brances are used locally. When you push a branch to GitHub, it is only that one branch
that is shared, it is disconnected from commits from other brances. Clones are exact copies of a commit, and
they can be stored either remote or locally. A fork is like a clone, but it is only remote. Once it is moved
to a local machine it becomes just a clone.
I would use a branch while working locally. It is what I would use when I'm actively coding and making
changes. I would use a clone mainly when working locally as well, a fork is best for working on a remote
commit.
