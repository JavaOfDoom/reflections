Question: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I believe that when you initialize a repository it creates the location where all future information
will be located. Just like in any file usage in a computer, you must first have a directory to hold the
information before you put the information in. It would be like trying to fill a glass of water without
the glass, you would have just water that would go everywhere. Before we can start making our commits, we need
a place for the commits to live.

Question: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you
think it offers?

I get to work on my code and use the staging area to hold parts of code that I want to eventually commit
to the repository, but it saves me from having to save the entire code and instead just commit a specific
list to the repository. I can use the working directory to check out the code i've commited and if I should
have to change it I can revert to a previous commit. That is my understading so far. It's one more way for
me to be able to work on code, save file space, and have access to all modifications along the way should
I need to change things.
